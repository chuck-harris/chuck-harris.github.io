Posted from Oakhurst, this sixth day of Alturiak, in the Year of the Silent Death.

My dearest Lady Katerina,

I hope this letter finds you well. While it has only been a few days since I last saw you, it
seems an eternity I have wandered in the dark since I last beheld your radiance. I expect that
I shall return soon cloaked in glory, and proven worthy of your hand.

As you can gather from the postmark on this letter, I have successfully completed my journey
to Oakhurst. It was certainly an eventful trip. I accompanied a merchant caravan, along with
a few other travellers. A few days out of Neverwinter, the caravan was attacked by goblins. Not
normal goblins, mind you --- they must have bred with hobgoblins or maybe ogres judging by their
size. A swarm of arrows whistled through the air at the caravan --- one stuck into a sack of
flour I was leaning on, barely missing my head. The caravan guards moved quickly, but it was
clear they were out-matched by the beasts.

I jumped from the wagon, rapier in hand. It seems my reputation had circulated even there, for
I could see the fear in their eyes when they faced me. Well, "faced me" would be generous, as
none of them would stand before me in a fight. I bloodied my blade, but they fled into the
forest at first threat. I guess the people of the region lack either the courage or the skill
to stand up to aggression.

There was another traveller journeying to Oakhurst, a somewhat over-the-hill knight of Torm.
I suppose he gave a fair accounting of himself in the battle with the goblins, and I saw him
heal one of the guards that had been nearly slain by a couple of goblins. A useful fellow in
a fight, I suppose. He said he's here in Oakhurst looking for his mentor, a somewhat potty
knight named Brayford who may or may not have stolen a magic sword from their temple.
Apparently the man gathered a bunch of kids with delusions of grandeur and went off on some
quest. None of them came back, leaving at least one grieving mother there in Oakhurst, the
proprietor of the general store.

The knight, a chap named Sir Russ, begged me for my help. I don't know how he heard that I was
a questing hero, but he clearly recognized that only one of my considerable skills could aid
him on his quest. I agreed, and we prepared to set out following the group.

We ate at the pre-eminent tavern in Oakhurst, the Old Boar. I think it was perhaps named for
its owner, a dull man named Garren. The patrons were equally dim --- I tried to lead them in
some songs, but you would think they had never heard a double entendre. They completely missed
the point of "Every Good Knight Couches His Lance" and "A Wizard's Staff Has A Knob On The End",
but finally appreciated "The Three Cormyrian Whores". Zounds, I thought Neverwinter was
provincial. The food was passable, I suppose, and the wine was potable, but I probably wouldn't
insult your palate by offering it to you.

It seems no one hunts or travels the direction they went, leaving us no guides. We spoke to
the priestess Nak in the village's shrine, and while she had no desire to adventure with us,
she pointed us toward her niece, who apparently lives an isolated life in the forest outside
the village. After spending a day in village, I think she may well be the wisest person in
several leagues.

Sir Russ and I are about to leave Oakhurst in search of this girl and ultimately the lost
adventurers. You will doubtless hear from me soon, crowned in honor and glory. I yearn to
return to you shortly, and you never leave my thoughts.

As ever, I am in your service,

Niccolo Kormallis
